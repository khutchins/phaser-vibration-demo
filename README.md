# Vibration Demo

This is a demonstration to go along with the blog post at https://blog.khutchins.com/posts/phaser-3-inputs-ac/ that has instructions for setting up controller vibrations in Phaser 3.

## Setup

I haven't tested these steps myself, but running this should be as simple as:

1. Run `npm install` in the base directory.
2. Run `npm run dev` to run a local version of the game.
